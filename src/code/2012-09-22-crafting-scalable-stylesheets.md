[Here's the slide deck](https://speakerdeck.com/u/mikefowler/p/crafting-scalable-stylesheets) from the talk I gave today at [VTCodeCamp](http://vtcodecamp.org). I spoke on some ways that Sass and Compass can help create more maintainable and scalable systems. I had a great time presenting and for everybody that made it to my talk: thanks for swinging by.
