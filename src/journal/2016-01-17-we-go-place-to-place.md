Wake up in Napa. There is a cat on your lap. The cat purrs in time to the
falling rain. Memories of the previous night leak slowly back in; wine in the
afternoon, music at dusk, conversation all night. First an upscale party, later
an artistsâ€™ commune. You arrived late and were greeted with hugs and
hospitality. You kept your eyes open as long as possible and crashed after
midnight. Slept through the night on a sofa fabricated in heaven. Woke to
showers and a gray winter sky. Slipped out early to find food and drove lazily
back to the city. Found more friends and spent another night drenched in
laughter. Stories over burritos. Kept your face to the pavement, walking in the
rain, bar to bar. Got home late and collapsed on your bed. You felt blessed in
the purest of senses that humans are kind and for when friendship comes easy.
Happiness, it is said, is best when shared.

You concur.
