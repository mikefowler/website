For the past fifty days, I’ve been writing at night. I am often not functional
in the morning, and the brief time I do claim in the early hours often goes
toward reading. And so I’ve found myself writing these entries late, frequently
from my bed, as I struggle to keep my eyes open for just one more sentence. And
while some nights I manage to write something I feel is of worth, more and more
the past several weeks I’ve noticed a lack of inspiration when I need it most.

The mornings, however, are a period of supreme alertness—this is why I usually
read in the mornings; I can focus intently. Starting this weekend, I’m going to
attempt to prioritize writing in the mornings. I’m curious how my morning
thoughts may differ from the evening’s. Perhaps lingering dreamscapes will
inspire fiction, or a faint waking memory will trigger a previously lost story
from my childhood. Whatever the case, I won’t be falling asleep at the keys.
