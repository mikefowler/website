Tonight you spent 45 minutes writing an exposition on longevity and its impact
on so-termed “quality of life”. You wrote for 45 minutes in order to determine
that only one sentiment mattered. Then you scrapped what you wrote and wrote
this instead.

_Wish for health. Pray for old age. But whether you live to be 80 years old or
130, scientific advancements and medical procedures will not cure your regret of
not living fully while you had the chance._
