In 2012 I landed at San Francisco International Airport with one suitcase and a
carry-on. Henceforth I was one among 800,000 others living in this spirited,
weird, warmhearted city. In time I would come to acknowledge that I was
unwittingly joining the ranks of what some call the “tech elite”, a blanket
classification used to typecast any person working at a company that makes
software. In 2012, though, I was wide-eyed and awash with awe to be in the midst
of such talent and innovation. San Francisco, after all, was founded on this
very spirit of innovation. I threw myself headlong into the world of startups.

Shortly after moving to the city I attended my first tech meetup, an event
called Protonight. The premise of Protonight is this: you arrive and elect to be
cast as an _idea person_ or an _engineer_. Subsequently you are randomly paired
with one person of the opposite role, and spend two hours working together on
whatever you wish. It was a fun night, and with free beer and food at the door,
who could complain?

I received something else that night, the only takeaway relevant to the piece
you are currently reading.

_I received my first piece of swag._

It was a t-shirt, the logo of the meetup’s sponsor splashed over the back in
bright blue. For the uninitiated, “swag” is a term used to describe free,
promotional handouts. When I attended Warped Tour in high school, record labels
handed out free stickers: swag. On orientation weekend during freshman year of
college, I received a free sling bag, the school’s crest screen-printed on the
front: also swag. The dentist I saw as a child gave out free Crest toothbrushes
after a routine cleaning: in a weird way, also swag. Swag is based wholly on the
principle that people love free things, and that if those people use or wear
those free things, it is effectively free marketing for the company.

It was not long before I too was indoctrinated in the ways of San Francisco swag
acquisition. It goes like this:

- _Get hired:_ get swag.
- _Attend a tech talk:_ get swag.
- _Company has a good quarter:_ get swag.
- _Attend a conference:_ get swag from seven companies you don’t know.
- _Company rebrands:_ get swag.
- _Apply to a new company:_ get swag after interviewing.
- _Get hired again:_ get more swag.

After three years in San Francisco, I have more freely acquired t-shirts stacked
in my bureau than I’ve purchased on my own in the same period. I have hoodies
from each of the companies I’ve worked for. Socks. Sweaters. Scarves, even (for
those terribly frigid 55**° **nights?). Should I care to, I could skip around
the city fully clad in branded apparel, a veritable walking billboard, all
without having put forth a cent.

But I don’t.** Because in a city undergoing rapid change and nearly unfettered
gentrification of certain neighborhoods, walking around bearing the logos of
tech companies seems, to me, akin to branding gentrification. **For want of
brand recognition and cheap marketing, tech companies are creating a subtle
exclusionary tactic that proclaims the very stereotype we aim to disprove: _we
are the tech elite, and you are not. We belong to these companies, and you
don’t._

I am not defined by the companies I work for. If anything, I identify with the
city, one which preaches love, inclusion, and uniqueness… not the companies that
call it their home. If we support _any_ businesses via branded clothing, it
should be the small ones: companies that give back to San Francisco’s spirit of
diversity, ones that have called the Bay home for far longer than any
venture-funded startup.

For your consideration.
