This is one. Arrive home, quarter past three, not a single idea of what to write
about. Reminisce on the evening. Drinks at Southern Pacific. Then “emo night” at
Knockout, with Brand New blasting out the speakers. Cheap beer and rounds of
shots. Photo booth captures and post-bar burritos across the street. Classic San
Francisco. Late night cab home with four stops between the Mission and the
Richmond. Blissful sleep.
