Inspiration seeks you out in the strangest of places.

In January 2012 I ventured with a group of friends from our then-home of
Burlington, Vermont to Portland, Maine. My excellent friend [Craig
Winslow](http://craigwinslow.com/) grew up in nearby Falmouth, and his parents
were gracious enough to host six of us at their home for a long weekend. I
remember the weekend as carefree and refreshing, in the midst of close friends
and inspirited by that special magic of being in a new place.

A highlight that weekend was our presence at the annual Portland Harbor Hotel
Ice Bar, a locally beloved winter tradition of dancing and cold cocktails, the
latter being prepared outside in the hotel’s courtyard. Bundled up against the
chill and squeezing our way through the crowd, we bumped to the soft house music
swirling about the four surrounding walls and watched bartenders pour drinks
into ice sculptures outfitted with funnels and tubes. Blue lights shone through
the ethereal, glassy statues, and the crystalline solution that poured out the
bottom to be served as a drink tasted like icy raspberries, nary a hint of
alcohol.

Inside we ate hors d’oeuvres and danced. The DJs played a considerate mix of
classics and modern dance tunes, ranging from Journey to disco to Avicii. Our
small collection of friends was joined that night not only by Craig’s parents
but by two of his grandparents, all four of whom joined us on the dance floor.
In a moment of memorable clarity, I grinned, amused by the unlikely scenario of
dancing to club music with three generations of Winslows, an experience I’d
never had, nor ever will, with my own family.

As one song ended and the first notes to The Black Eyed Peas “I Gotta Feeling”
bounced forth from the speakers, I turned to Craig’s grandmother.

> _“Tell me—and please be honest—what do you think of my generation’s music?”_

In that moment I was recalling conversations with relatives who had confidently
proclaimed that “all the stuff coming out these days is *bullshit”, *convinced
that good music ended when tapes became more popular than vinyls. And as harsh
as such a statement is, there are times I might partially agree. The age of
easily obtained, cheap electronics and free, immediate internet distribution
has, wonderfully, opened the world of making music to nearly anybody and
subsequently introduced the world at large to more music each year than one
could have fathomed when record labels first began. More music and easier ways
to discover it means, inevitably, more outright _bad_ music.

Hearing my question, this wise woman gazed off wistfully, just for a moment.
With the above in mind, I braced myself for a polite but slighting response.
Instead, she changed my life.

> _“I think that music is about where you are and who you’re with when you hear
> it. So yes, I like this music.”_

I could have wept with admiration even in this moment, yet somehow time has
instilled an even greater sense of profundity in her simple response. It is a
sentiment that sticks with me still, one that I hope guides me for the rest of
my time living. Because sitting silently among those words is a much deeper
meaning, a philosophical belief about how to approach aging.

> “It’s said that the biggest determinant of our lives is whether we see the world

> Road](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15451058-my-life-on-the-road)

To extend this metaphor—that of embracing or discrediting new music as an
indicator of how you approach life—I see the act of mistrusting all things new
and different, like assuming that all new music is inherently inferior, is a
subtle form of viewing the world through a hostile lens. Admittedly, it’s
shockingly easy to fall prey to the negative aspects of nostalgia, the so-named
Golden Age Syndrome that pushes you down the road of “things were better back
then”. A way of welcoming such change, a practice that Gloria Steinem suggests
is a self-fulfilling prophecy, would be to embrace new types of music, and
indeed all new experiences, for their ability to teach you new things, to teach
you more about yourself, and to inspire, regardless of whether the song (or
experience) is to your liking or not.

To this end, I’ve thought for a long while about writing a sort of _manifesto on
aging._ When I originally sat down to write this piece, a few weeks ago, I idly
searched the internet for this term. To my surprise, not only did I quickly
locate writing of a similar nature, but a TEDx talk by with that _exact_ name.
It was given by Jon Katz in 2013.

You can find [the talk in written
form](http://www.bedlamfarm.com/2013/11/10/my-10-point-creative-aging-manifesto-ted-talk-montclair-1192013/)
on Katz’s website, but I will finish by reproducing certain pieces of it here,
as I echo his sentiments in full and his words are far more elegant than mine.
The written version linked above is titled “How to Get Older in America”.

> “I will never downsize my mind or my life, I will never cease to be open to
> life. A closed mind is the first and saddest death, the death of the mind.”

---

> “I will never complain about the young and talk about how they are not as
> hard-working, thoughtful or responsible as I was at their age, I will never talk
> about the good old days, they were never really all that good, I am not here to
> turn back the clock.”

---

> “I embrace and accept new technologies, new realities, not as unwanted
> intrusions, but as the parade of change that defines a fulfilled life at any
> age. Nostalgia is a trap, our lives are what we make of them each day.”

---

> “I approach growing older with acceptance, not denial, with grace, not
> avoidance, with the embrace of the new, not withdrawal and retreat.”

To Jon and his sagacious manifesto, and Craig’s wise grandmother: you are models
by which I aim to live. I owe you, and others like you, way more than thanks.
