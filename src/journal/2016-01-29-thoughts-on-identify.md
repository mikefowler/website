If you’ve been following along, you may
have noticed my praise
for Gloria Steinem’s book *My Life on the Road; *I blazed through it last week
and haven’t yet stopped reflecting on certain passages. Furthermore, if you were
to have spent any serious amount of time with me in the past six months, there’s
a strong likelihood that I’d have given you an earful about David Foster Wallace
and _Infinite Jest_ (humans in their 20s reading and raving about _Infinite
Jest_ is practically becoming a stereotype in its own right, but the thing is
that the hype is justified, the man had a remarkable sense of foresight).

I found that I was able to draw a nice parallel between one of the lines I
highlighted in _My Life on the Road _(this will be the second time I’ve cited it
this week, albeit expanded here) and an often reiterated sentiment of Wallace’s.
Steinem writes:

> The travel writer Bruce Chatwin wrote that our nomadic past lives on in our

Media and its role in American culture was debatably the single most frequently
discussed topic in Dave Wallace’s work. He suggested that our consumption of
media often knows no bounds, comparing our obsession to eating candy for every
meal (“real pleasurable, but it doesn’t have any calories in it”, he says).
During his interviews with David Lipsky in _Of Course You End Up Becoming
Yourself_, Wallace says, also of media:

> …we’re absolutely dying to give ourselves away to something. To run, to escape,
> somehow.

Juxtaposed as such, I think there is a strong likelihood that the _something_
Dave Wallace suggests we all seek is exactly as Gloria Steinem suggests: a
desire for movement, for migration, for exploration. Chuck Palahniuk, in _Fight
Club_, wrote that “our generation has had no Great war, no Great Depression. Our
war is spiritual.” And while that observation was written before the horrific
events of September 11th and the ensuing war in Iraq, the truth lies in that, on
the whole, our generation does not have a _just cause_ to give ourselves away
to. Instead we turn to media, because at least that provides some basis for
developing an identity; personalities we can relate to, fictional events that
draw our sympathies when we see similarities in our own lives, the failures and
triumphs of a stranger’s life.

The question, in my mind, is *should we be allowing media to shape our identity?
*Wallace addressed this as well, suggesting that “the technology’s gonna get
better and better at doing what it does, which is seduce us into being
incredibly dependent on it, so that advertisers can be more confident that we
will watch their advertisements. And as a technology system, it’s amoral. […] It
doesn’t have a responsibility to care about us one whit more than it does: It’s
got a job to do. The moral job is ours.”

There are two diametrically opposed philosophies here. On one side, travel and
exploration as a way of finding and shaping our identities. On the other,
letting our identities be formed by the influences of the media we consume. We
all read the two options above and hope for ourselves the first, and yet, as the
timeless mantra goes, the first step to fixing a problem is admitting that you
have one. Again, David Foster Wallace:

> …probably each generation has different things that force the generation to grow
> up. Maybe for our grandparents it was World War Two. You know? For us, it’s
> gonna be that at, at a certain point, that we’re either gonna have to put away
> childish things and discipline ourself about how much time do I spend being
> passively entertained? And how much time do I spend doing stuff that actually
> isn’t all that fun minute by minute, but that builds certain muscles in me as a
> grown-up and a human being?

What forces shape your identity? Are those forces a result of travel and
personal exploration? How much of your identity is shaped by things other people
suggest that you care about? It is a job for each of us to answer these
questions.
