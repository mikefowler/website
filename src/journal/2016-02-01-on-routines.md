Tonight I’m celebrating a small milestone as we tumble into the 2nd month of the
year. Over the past 31 days I’ve succeeded in establishing a writing routine.
It’s not perfect—not by a long shot, with many rushed entries and nights staying
up too late to finish—but it’s something. To date I’ve written essays
exclusively. The format comes naturally to me, and I enjoy ruminating on past
memories. Going forward I want to mix in [some
fiction](https://medium.com/@michaelrfowler/free-62c8d8d9bc4a#.mv6ljv3dg) and
longer essays. I may write less in my daily entries in order to put more time
into substantial pieces.

More than anything, it’s been fun realizing the ways in which I am both strong
and exceptionally weak in writing. My corollary is teaching myself—over the
course of 6 years—what is now my profession. The first time you teach yourself
something and became a so-called “expert” at it, you don’t often notice the
process. You’re fueled by a blind ambition to do it, and do it all the time. By
the time you’re good enough to call yourself A Something™ you barely remember
when and how you learned everything you know.

It’s slightly different the second go-round. Your success in another area of
your life makes you impatient. You know what it feels like to be proficient at
something and it’s a drag when it takes substantial time to even become mediocre
at a new thing. It’s a brilliant lesson in patience.

So here’s to one month down and a lifetime worth of months to go.
