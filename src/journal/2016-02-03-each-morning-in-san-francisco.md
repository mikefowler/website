Each morning I bike by the San Francisco Symphony en route to work. On some
mornings it is still outside, the arcs of its exterior wall stately in the
morning light. On others, like this morning, there are buses lined outside and
stampedes of children milling about, accompanied by what always seems to be far
too few adults to manage such a crowd. On these mornings Iâ€™m shocked and
delighted by the sheer number of children. Cities, despite their densely
occupied grid of streets, do not always betray their youthful populations to
daily commuters. Surely the children are either at home or at school, but they
somehow escape our recognition, those of us without kids of our own. The sudden
appearance of adolescent multitudes brings a frenzy of excitement and fervor
that makes me smile. Especially in San Francisco, a city of overworked technical
minds, the vigor and naive wonder of youth would be nice to see more.
