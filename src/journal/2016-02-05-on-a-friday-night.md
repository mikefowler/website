Pedal, pedal, pedal, burrito as reward. Beers and guacamole. Pedal again, this
time home. Clean, clean, clean, go out again. Cheap beer and invaluable friends.
Dancing barefoot in the living room and everybody knows the words. Walking
downhill to home, a new friend tells jokes. They go for pizza, you go to your
bed. The nine hours after work can bring love and entertainment and
satisfaction.
