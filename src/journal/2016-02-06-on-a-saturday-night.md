Stopping on Haight Street for food and coffee walks down to Hippie Hill.
Wandering through Memorial Grove and look, people using ketamine. To the pond
and chatting with ducks. “The bat dove for my pebble!” Card games and drinks at
home and there’s big band playing. Junky snacks and passing it around. The
Mystery Team solves the case.
