As I walked home from the library, the soft scuffle of gravel underfoot went
_crshhh, crshhh, crshhh_. At the next corner, a man shuffling up the sidewalk
with a slight limp, favoring his right side, layered on _shhhhhhh–tck,
shhhhhhh–tck_. The wind overhead, seeping and flowing through the grid of
buildings, _fffoooooooooshhhh_, a soft ethereal melody underneath the beat. A
howling child accompanied by mom passed by across the street,
_ahhheeeeeeeyeeaaaa_, a backing vocal.

The music of casual living, spontaneous and unexpected. We are the lyrics,
living out the verse. Smile at the sweet refrain.
