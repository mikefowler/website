The past two days, I tore through Rebecca Solnit’s _Men Explain Things to Me_, a
collection of essays which includes her now-famous piece of the same name, the
contents of which I’ll reflect on later this week.

In an accompanying essay titled _Woolf’s Darkness_, a piece about Virginia
Woolf, Solnit discusses Woolf’s propensity for writing about escaping the home
as an act of freedom, especially for women of her time. One passage in
particular spoke strongly to me—and likely would to many of us—of the sense of
clear, clairvoyant observation we find outside, walking around. It speaks to the
voice in our head we wish we could capture.

> Introspection is often portrayed as an indoor, solitary thing, the monk in his
> cell, the writer at her desk. Woolf disagrees, saying of the home “For there we
> sit surrounded by objects which enforce the memories of our own experience.” She
> describes the objects and then states, “But when the door shuts on us, all that
> vanishes. The shell-like covering which our souls have excreted to house
> themselves, to make for themselves a shape distinct from others, is broken, and
> there is left of all these wrinkles and roughnesses a central pearl of
> perceptiveness, an enormous eye. How beautiful a street is in winter!”
