I’ve only just now reentered my apartment after its evacuation earlier tonight.
The house next to ours, and the one next to it, caught fire. A “three alarm
fire”, dozens of emergency response vehicles lining the blocks surrounding Lyon
and Fulton Street. Flames leaping out the top of the house. Almost 50 people
displaced, even after the fire was contained and extinguished. And as I fall
asleep, tired and satisfied after a beautiful day outside bouldering, scrambling
up rocks made a million years before, I marvel also at the sobering effect of
seeing fire so easily destroy things that humans built.
