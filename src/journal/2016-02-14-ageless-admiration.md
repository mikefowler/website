I’m standing on a rock overlooking the ocean, just south of Jenner on Highway 1.
The sun is setting, painting the type of picture you feel honored to witness. I
spent this day, and the one before it, taking part in an act as ageless as
watching the sky at dusk: climbing up rocks. And while rope and harnesses give
us measurable added comfort as compared to our long ago kin, the fascination and
simplicity have gone unchanged.

Long before marketers invented Valentines Day — indeed perhaps even before
homosapiens possessed the language to express love toward one another — we’ve
seen the sun set and felt alive because of it. Its beauty is not one we needed a
magazine to convince us of, its worth not bolstered by capitalism. Our ageless
admiration of the Earth for simply _being_ endures.
