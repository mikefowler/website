Tomorrow evening I fly first to Los Angeles, then to Sydney, Australia, and
finally to Denpasar, Bali. I’ll be there about a week, then another half week in
Sydney before I fly back to Frisco. Don’t expect to see me writing here, but
I’ll be wandering through rice fields, walking up volcanoes, diving off the Amed
coast and writing in each spare moment. _Aku cinta kamu._
