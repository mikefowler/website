With each temporary departure from a culture of media — one of timeliness and
overtime, of texting and collective avoidance of face-to-face communication— and
with each subsequent return, I taunt the imprisoned spirit we’ve each caged, one
handed down in blood since time immemorial. With each journey: a bloom of color
flourishing amidst nature, primal living, and daily reflection. With each
journey’s end: a doused flame, the resuming decay of childlike wonder. And as
the cycle begins anew, an ever-stronger call to return, lest our spirits wither.
