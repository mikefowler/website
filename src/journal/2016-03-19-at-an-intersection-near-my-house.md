At an intersection near my house where a convenient storeâ€™s neon illuminates the
sidewalk out front, an old man sits nearby, methodically smoking a cigarette
down to its filter. I see him at all hours: sometimes in the morning as I pedal
by on my route to work, but just as often at dusk as I walk to get groceries,
the fiery red, lit end of his butt winking open and closed like a tiny eye from
a distance. He sits in a way that does not suggest comfort, with his back to a
telephone poll, knees drawn up against his chest with limbs splayed out to the
side, the arm that shuttles the cigarette pivoting against his leg like a
drawbridge being raised and lowered again. You can all but hear the squeaks of
his ancient machinery as he drags deep and sinks lower into his pose. His eyes
are fixed at an arbitrary point on the cement ten feet away, seeing something
far beyond San Francisco.
