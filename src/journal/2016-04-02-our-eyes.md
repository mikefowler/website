Our eyes met, separated by a thin pane of glass and 10 feet of concrete, but
entire galaxies couldn’t fill the gap in our individual experiences. I was
sitting in the backseat of a car, head leaned against the glass, enjoying the
infrequent luxury of quiet and comfort in a cab on my way to work. I saw him as
my car slowed for a red light, hunched with one other man on the sidewalk
nearby. He was my age, dressed casually with the patchy start of a bleach blond
beard. He appeared nervous, as if on edge, but friendly. His head rose and made
a quick assessment of his surroundings. He saw me staring, but I held my gaze;
when he looked back a heartbeat later, he held his. We shared three tantalizing
seconds of eye contact; I can’t know what he saw in my look, but in his I read
fear, or perhaps surprise at receiving such direct attention. I looked away
first, feeling uncomfortable for a reason I didn’t understand, and in my
periphery I saw him bow once again to the crack pipe.
