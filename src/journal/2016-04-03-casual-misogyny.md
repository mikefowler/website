I rode the late bus home tonight. Two AM from Mission and 16th back to the Panhandle. On the 5, I was sitting in front of two men having this conversation, which I had the gross displeasure of overhearing.

“*Dude, there were some *MILFs\* at that party.”\*\*

_“Dude, yea, some serious MILFs.”_

_“Dude, like as soon as I grew up, I realized how hot MILFs are. Yo, you know my friend Mustafa?”_

_“Yea?”_

*“He like *only* goes after MILFs. I’ll show him this hot girl our age and he’ll be like *nah*, but then he’ll show me like some 35 year old woman he’s into.”*

_“And does he get in that?”_

_“Yea, dude. The first time he ever had sex was with like a hot 30 year old. The thing is that he just knows what he wants and goes after it.”_

_“Dude, that’s awesome.”_

_“Yea, I got mad respect for him.”_

Remember, men: girls are yours for the taking. Just say what you want and then go “get in that”. That’s how you earn the respect of your bros.

\*For those uninitiated, this is the popular acronym for Mothers I’d Like to Fuck.
