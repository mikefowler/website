title: Wiretap our heads

If you wiretapped our heads
and ferreted through the threads,
of worries and sorrows,
our hopes for tomorrow,
and projected the sound,
made audible, profound,
weâ€™d hear in each other
the fear that we smother,
of failure and loneliness
and death and unhappiness,
a cacophony of dread
just locked in our head.
