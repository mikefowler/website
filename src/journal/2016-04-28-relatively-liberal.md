In March, while I was in Sydney on a three-day layover, I spent what to some
would seem an inordinate amount of time reading in coffee shops for a first-time
visitor to the city. Don’t worry, I did some fun things while there, but what I
love most about traveling is the opportunity to experience _living_ there. In
San Francisco I spend a great deal of time in cafés. They are comfortable,
anonymous and lovely, postage-stamp-sized microcosms of the cities they occupy.
And so I sat.

On one of these occasions, enjoying the airy back patio of Sappho Books Cafe,
two women sat down at a table nearby. Their conversation suggested they were
students, and when they unloaded their bags into a sprawling, literary
smorgasbord of study materials, this intuition was confirmed. Some time later,
their conversation turned to the American election.

“I don’t really understand how the American primaries work”, said one.

The other responded, “It’s when each political party decides who their nominee
for President will be. So there’s the Democrats and the Republicans. The
Democrats are the good guys and the Republicans are the psychotic assholes”.

I stifled a laugh, not only to avoid garnering attention, but because it was the
third such conversation I’d heard in as many days in Sydney.

So says Pete Ross in [an insightful opinion
piece](http://observer.com/2016/04/heres-the-thing-so-many-americans-cant-grasp-about-bernie-sanders/)
for Observer. The tie-in to my story above is that Pete Ross is Australian. And
while my anecdotal evidence gathered while in Sydney is just that, what Pete
expresses seems to be a truth that resonates in many countries around the world.
Pete goes on to expound upon the so-called “wacky” ideas of Bernie Sanders.

What would the effect be, I wonder, of giving socialized democracy a new name?
In lieu of branding a candidate as “socialist”—a tag that for some will all but
_ensure_ that they never listen to a word of that candidate’s speaking
points—why don’t we let candidates speak for themselves, rather than weighing
them down with the connotations of a party?

It’s sad to consider that the news media, itself a frequently liberal voice, may
contribute to Bernie Sanders coming up short on delegates in the Democratic
primary. But it is perhaps even more distressing that the hordes of middle class
Americans who have flocked to the most xenophobic, sexist, elitist candidate to
run for President in recent history want the same for our country as does
another candidate: Bernie Sanders. And just because of the ugly, misinformed
connotations of socialism in the United States.

But hey, we couldn’t possibly set our standards by those of another country.
That’d be awfully un-American, right Mr. Trump?
