June marks three full months of wandering. May took me to eight towns or cities across four states. Here are some moments.

- At the beginning of the month I was finishing up an Airbnb stay in South Berkeley with two incredible hosts, Miriam and Manuel.
- The first week of the month I housesat in Noe Valley, in San Francisco, kept company by the restless, if incredibly cute, Hobbes the Cat.
- Two nights following were spent at an underwhelming Airbnb in Berkeley that reminded me how important genuine hospitality is.
- I then flew to Arizona and spent three days in Arcosanti at FORM Festival: teared up listening to Phil Elverum, fell asleep to Bing and Ruth’s serenades, danced until the early morning at Skrillex’s DJ set in the canyon.
- Before heading back to California, I spent one night and one day in Sedona, Arizona; hiked up the stunning Cathedral Rock.
- Back in the city, I spent three comfortable nights living in West Oakland with my Airbnb hosts Julia and Austen.
- The next weekend I took a bus to Camp Mendocino for Camp Grounded: I read my writing aloud on stage for the first time; helped write, and acted in, the camp play; like the year before, cried on the bus ride home.
- After a brief stay back in the city, I flew to Austin, Texas, where I lived for a week: ate a lot of vegan food (Arlo’s, if we’re being honest); swam in the cool of Barton Creek; partied on a boat with some of my best friends.
- Flew up to Brooklyn, and (completely coincidentally) spent the first three hours of June at a bar called June.
