After a hectic month of travel in May, June was a slow jaunt through my northeast haunts.

- The first eighteen days of the month I lived in Bushwick, Brooklyn, with Devan and her roommate Maddy
- While in New York, I spent time with a whole bunch of lovely people: Devan; Sean; Spencer; Kyrsten; Michelle; Valerie; Maddy; Chris; Alyssa; Hilary; camp friends Lychee and Pocket; San Francisco buds Brent and Caroline; Portland friends Craig and Maggie.
- I saw a couple of plays, _The Play That Goes Wrong_, and _Oslo_. I saw _The Suitcase Junket_ perform for the second time. I saw the New York Neo Futurists put on their new show _The Infinite Wrench_.
- I ate at a lot of new (to me) vegan restaurants: Black Flamingo, Jajaja, Orchard Grocery, Modern Love, Toad Style. I went to the New York Vegan Street Fair.
- From New York I flew to Burlington, Vermont, and immediately left for a a three day music road trip with Dad. In Saratoga, New York we saw _Dead and Company_, the current reincarnation of the _Grateful Dead_, led by John Mayer on guitar. In Bethlehem, New Hampshire we saw Richard Thompson, of Fairport Convention fame.
- I took four days of solo time at Perch Pond, working during the day, and painting or writing at night.
- I turned 29 years old, and had birthday dinner with Mom in Burlington, at Revolution Kitchen.
- Just before the days slid into July, I saw _The DuPont Brothers_ with Dad, at Hotel Vermont.
