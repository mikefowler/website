It is the beginning of September, and July 1<sup>st</sup> seems like a decade ago.

- I spent the first week of July in Vermont with family. I painted; I swam; I wrote; I recorded voiceovers for the next episode of my then-as-yet-unnamed podcast.
- After arriving back in the Bay, I had a short stint living in West Oakland. Next door to the house was a carwash. A wall around the parking lot was decorated with statues of horse heads. Most of the horses were missing noses.
- I spent a week housesitting for Shonna in Lower Haight; I celebrated Caroline's birthday; I saw _Now Now_ with Alex; I caught up with Valerie as she passed through San Francisco for a day; I saw _Danger_ perform a set and danced my ass off, blissfully alone.
- Dece Scouts drove north to Trinity Alps and [basked in the majesty of Siligo Peak](https://decescouts.com/trips/four-lakes-loop).
- Mike and I had a tiny picnic on the Embarcadero. It was mercilessly windy. We ate sandy raspberries.
- Dave and I saw Mystery Science Theater 3000 perform their live show.
- Cait and I rode coasters at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk; "swam" in the ocean; fell asleep on the beach.
- I hosted a small Camp Grounded reunion in Golden Gate Park. Windflower roasted marshmallows on the spot with a crème brûlée torch.

- On the first day of August, I published [my first podcast](/an-irrevocable-condition)!
- Dece Scouts threw a belated one-year anniversary in Dolores Park.
- I flew to New York and watched Sean and Katie be wed to one another.
- I watched, with weak knees, as Spencer proposed to Michelle on the Brooklyn Promenade.
- I worked as a counselor at [Camp Wonderful](www.campwonderful.com); as ever, camp changed my life in myriad, tiny ways.
- At a bar in the Lower East Side, I celebrated the birthday of a new camp friend and a successful camp with a bunch of my new buddies.
- As the month came to a close, I flew north to Burlington to spend Memorial Day weekend with family.
